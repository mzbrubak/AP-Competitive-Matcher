# AP-Competitive-Matcher

How to use:

1. Copy all rows corresponding to players in the current game from here into values.txt The selection will include the far left column (player names) and the top row (game names).  Omit columns after the last listed game from the selection: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17jgUyVK5PYnv-u29_wVT1YmmRN9hZOuF3H4JikAyJCc/edit?usp=sharing
2. Set the amount of teams in the variable around line 42
3. Probably don't change anything and just run main.py
4. If you just get "Process finished with code 0", that means no valid match was found. In this case, you are probably working with a bigger team size, and should loosen the restrictions (especially on "minimum level" and "maximum difference")
